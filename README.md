# Website www.everestserver.pl

Beautiful & responsive website for EverestServer.

## A few words of introduction:
This is a website I created for my home server. Currently, it serves as a hub, so that the users are able to select which service of the server they want to use.

## Used technologies:
* HTML
* CSS
* Sass
* Bootstrap
* JavaScript
* jQuery

## Prerequisites:
* Install npm (it comes bundled with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
* Install [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install)

## How to set up locally?
1. Clone the repository
	```
	$ git clone "https://github.com/jonaszkadziela/everestserver.pl.git"
	```
1. Enter **everestserver.pl** project directory
	```
	$ cd everestserver.pl
	```
1. Install all dependencies
	```
	$ npm install
	```

## Development:
* File `assets/stylesheets/scss/main.scss` includes all other stylesheets and should be compiled into `assets/stylesheets/css/main.min.css`
* Folder `assets/javascripts/` contains all JavaScript files which preferably should be compiled into one file `assets/javascripts/main.min.js`
